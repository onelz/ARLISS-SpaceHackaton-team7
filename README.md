ARLISS-SpaceHackaton-Team7
==========================

Build a robot and fly it in a rocket! Deployed from a rocket in the Black Rock Desert at an altitude of more than 2 miles, your robot must find its way to a designated marker on the desert floor. Design a fixed wing, quad drone, rover or some other unique design with the mass and volume specifications. ARLISS (A Rocket Launch for International Student Satellites) is an international competition that began in 1999.
